## ✅ Test Objective

To verify the effectiveness of newly applied thermal paste under typical operating conditions by capturing:

- Idle CPU temperature
- Load test temperature
- Cooldown behavior
- Fan speeds and voltage behavior
- Sensor output from `sensors` command

---

## 🔍 Summary of Observations

### 🌡 Idle Temperatures (`idle-temps.txt`)
- **Core 0:** ~49–53°C  
- **Core 1:** ~52–57°C  
- **Package ID 0:** ~53–57°C  
- **Fan Speed:** ~1997 RPM  
- Indicates normal behavior for idle on older hardware, with consistent readings across cores.

---

### 🔥 Load Temperatures (`load-temps.txt`)
- **Core Temps:** Peaked at ~69–70°C  
- **Package:** ~69°C  
- **TC0F (CPU Die):** ~85.0°C  
- **Fan Speed:** 6067 RPM (maxed out)
- High but not overheating; system remains within safe operating range.

---

### ❄️ Cooldown (`cooldown-temps.txt`)
- Cores dropped to low-mid 50s within minutes.
- Fan speed returned to ~2000 RPM.
- Demonstrates solid thermal paste conductivity and heat dissipation.

---

## 🧠 Analysis

- ✅ No throttling observed during peak loads.
- ✅ Fan behavior responded appropriately to thermal load.
- ✅ Idle temperatures consistent and slightly improved from pre-paste estimates (not captured but typical ~60°C on aging paste).
- ⚠️ Load temperatures still brush against 85°C under max stress — expected for this hardware generation and chassis.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The thermal paste application was **successful**. System is now:

- Performing within expected thermal thresholds
- Responding quickly under load and cooldown
- Well-monitored for long-term use

> ✨ Suggest retesting seasonally or when workload noticeably increases.
